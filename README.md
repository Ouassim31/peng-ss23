# PENG COMPONENT
Dear developers and users, we are excited to introduce the PENG Component, a secure way to utilize the Open Authorization 2.0 framework. With PENG, you can enjoy the benefits of not having to repeatedly provide your credentials, while also ensuring that your connection to the relying party remains secure.

PENG Component acts as a third-party intermediary, providing both security and privacy features. We perform a series of transformations and obligations, as outlined below, to maintain the connection while protecting your personal information. Our top priority is your safety, and we ensure that your data is not shared with any other third parties. WE DON'T SAVE YOUR DATA!

A list of the personal data transformations:
- 
- Locale: Abstract, from City/Country to Continent
- E-Mail: Obfuscate, hashing (SHA-256)
- Birth date: Summarise, from exact date to age category
- Image / Domain / ID: Minimisation, Throw them away
- Access_token: Encryption
